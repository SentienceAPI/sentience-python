"""
Unit-test-only stubs.

The core Sentience SDK imports Playwright at module import time (`sentience.browser`),
but many unit tests don't actually need a real browser. In CI and developer envs,
Playwright is usually installed; however in constrained environments it may not be.

This conftest provides minimal `playwright.*` stubs so we can import the SDK and run
pure unit/contract tests without requiring Playwright.

IMPORTANT:
- These stubs are only active during pytest runs (via conftest import order).
- Integration/E2E tests that need real Playwright should install Playwright and will
  typically run in separate environments.
